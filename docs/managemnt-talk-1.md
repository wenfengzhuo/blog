During the national-wide lockdown, I gave a talk about performance at work in a live online event held by a popular BBS among Chinese in the US. The talk was mainly focusing two topics related to "performance":
* Performance Management
* Interview Performance

The goal of the sharing was to help students and people at work understand how performance is evaluated at work. **The uniqueness of the talk was the content was based on a manager's experience, which could give the audience a different `angle` to think about the high-stake performance-related matters.** 

A brief agenda of the talk was presented as follows:

* Introduction
* Performance Management
	* Performance Rating
	* Calibration
	* Promotion
	* Give Feedback
* Interview Performance
	* Screening
	* Phone Interview
	* Onsite
	* Evaluation (pre-brief, de-brief)
